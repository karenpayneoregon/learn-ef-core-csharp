# About

There are two data scripts.

- North2020.sql is the standard `Microsoft NorthWind` database
- North2022.sql is based off of `North2020.sql` with schema modifications.

**Note** 

Neither of these database is a stock Microsoft NorthWind database. In the originaly the relations where not broken out properly while the two databases here are better separated.
