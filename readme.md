# Entity Framework Core for beginners

A continuing series of how-to working Entity Framework Core for novice developers and seasoned developers who are interested in learning Entity Framework Core.

The majority of work will be done at first in console and unit test project while later will present desktop and web projects.

# Intentions

Intentions of content to follow is to acclimate developers who are interested in learning how to use EF Core starting at a rudimentary level with code samples that work rather than most code samples on the web that are not complete in one way or another.

Each concept will be broken down in levels were each level will be in a new branch in a single GitHub repository. This makes learning easier and no knowledge of how to perform merge request from the repository.

Monthly installments will be added for developers to learn basics to advance topics. There may be code that is not discussed in a prior to current topic but will be in a future topic.

All code is guaranteed to work outside a developerâ€™s environment or how their database has been setup.
